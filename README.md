# AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my AI portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects that explore the practical capabilities of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Each project is built with a focus on real-world application, experimentation.

## About Me

Iâ€™m a to-be junior developer passionate about artificial intelligence and its role in solving real-world problems. My work focuses on building projects that deepen my understanding of machine learning fundamentals while applying tools and frameworks from the latest AI research. I enjoy working with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and increasingly with LLMs via APIs and open-source models.

## AI Project Highlights

Here are some of the key areas that will be covered in this portfolio:

### Machine Learning (ML)
- Regression and classification models for structured data.
- Predictive modeling using scikit-learn and XGBoost.

### ðŸ§¬ Deep Learning (DL)
- Neural network architectures using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Image recognition and natural language tasks.

### ðŸ’¬ Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Experimentation with OpenAI, Google GenAI, and open-source LLMs.
- Prompt engineering and fine-tuning workflows.

Each project includes code, documentation, and insights gained during development.
